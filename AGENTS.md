# Agent Instructions

- Propose commit messages and PR titles/descriptions yourself unless explicitly provided.
- If the example app server is not running locally, use `npm run test:dist` (which runs `npm run build:example:dist`) to build the example web `dist/` and run system tests.
- Suggest relevant git branch names for the work when asked to create a PR or branch.
